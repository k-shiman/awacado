# AWACADO discord bot


A Discord bot written in JavaScript using the discord.js library is a program designed to automate certain tasks on the Discord platform. This bot has several commands that can be executed within Discord(Note: commands will be added, changed or removed). To use the commands listed for the Discord bot written in JavaScript using discord.js, the prefix used is "/".

## Command list:
· user  : Provides information about the user.

· server: Provides information about the server.

· ping  : Replies with "Pong!" to confirm that the bot is responsive.

· echo  : Replies with your input!

· chat  : Responds to user prompts with random messages(Note: in progress).


The bot's files are organized into separate folders, making it easy to create, modify, and delete commands and features without interfering with existing functionality. The use of the discord.js library simplifies the interaction with the Discord API, making it easier for developers to create custom commands and automate tasks on the platform. This project is still in progress.
